    <h1>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h1>
    <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. With IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow or deny their access to AWS resources.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts of AWS IAM</h2>
    <h3>Users</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals or applications that need to access AWS resources.</li>
        <li>Each IAM user can be given unique security credentials (e.g., an access key).</li>
        <li>IAM users can be assigned permissions by attaching policies directly to them.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Groups</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Collections of IAM users.</li>
        <li>Groups make it easier to manage permissions by grouping users and assigning policies to the group rather than to individual users.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IAM roles are intended to be assumed by authorized entities (like users or services) to gain specific privileges.</li>
        <li>Roles can be assumed temporarily, such as for EC2 instances to access other AWS services like S3 without embedding long-term credentials in the instance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Policies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A set of permissions that define what actions are allowed or denied for a user, group, or role.</li>
        <li>Policies are written in JSON and specify the allowed or denied actions on AWS resources.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)</h3>
    <p>Adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide not only a password but also a code generated by a hardware or software device.</p>
    
    <h3>Access Keys</h3>
    <p>Used for programmatic access (via CLI or SDK). Each IAM user can have two sets of access keys, consisting of an access key ID and a secret access key.</p>
    
    <h3>IAM Policy Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Managed Policies:</strong> Predefined by AWS or created by you to manage permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Inline Policies:</strong> Directly embedded within users, groups, or roles, offering more granular control.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Create and Use IAM</h2>
    <h3>Create an IAM User</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user or an admin user.</li>
        <li>Open the IAM Console.</li>
        <li>In the navigation pane, choose Users.</li>
        <li>Click Add user, give the user a unique username, and select the type of access (Programmatic access, AWS Management Console access, or both).</li>
        <li>Optionally add the user to a group that already has permissions or attach policies directly to the user.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Create an IAM Group</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the IAM Console, go to Groups.</li>
        <li>Click Create New Group and name the group.</li>
        <li>Attach permissions policies to the group based on the level of access required for users in the group.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Create an IAM Role</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the IAM Console, navigate to Roles.</li>
        <li>Click Create Role and select the trusted entity type (AWS service, another AWS account, or a web identity provider).</li>
        <li>Select permissions by attaching policies to the role, and define trust relationships.</li>
        <li>Use this role by allowing other services or users to assume the role when required.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Attach a Policy to a User/Group/Role</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to Users or Groups in the IAM Console.</li>
        <li>Select a user or group and go to the Permissions tab.</li>
        <li>Click Add Permissions, and choose a policy to attach (either managed or custom policies).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Enforce MFA</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the IAM Console, go to Users.</li>
        <li>Select the user, then click the Security Credentials tab.</li>
        <li>Under Assigned MFA device, click Manage MFA to assign an MFA device to the user.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Generate Access Keys for Programmatic Access</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Security Credentials section of an IAM user, click Create access key to generate an access key and secret access key.</li>
        <li>These keys are used to authenticate requests when using the AWS CLI or SDK.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>How to Use IAM</h2>
    <h3>Authentication</h3>
    <p>IAM users use either passwords or access keys to authenticate themselves for accessing AWS resources.</p>
    
    <h3>Authorization</h3>
    <p>Policies attached to users, groups, or roles control what actions they can perform.</p>
    <p>For example, you might allow an IAM user to read from an S3 bucket but deny the ability to delete objects.</p>
    
    <h3>Cross-Account Access</h3>
    <p>IAM roles can be used to allow one AWS account to access resources in another account.</p>
    
    <h3>Temporary Access</h3>
    <p>Roles enable users or services to assume temporary privileges for specific tasks, improving security by avoiding the use of permanent access credentials.</p>
    
    <h3>Automation</h3>
    <p>IAM integrates with AWS SDKs, CLI, and other services to automate the process of accessing AWS resources programmatically.</p>
